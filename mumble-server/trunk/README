This charm sets up a public Mumble server, for use by groups of people
wanting to do voice communication via the "mumble" client. When used
with other juju services, it will create a tree of channels designed to
help coordinate administrative tasks between admins.

Once running, the server, users, groups, ACLs, and additional channels
can be configured through the client, using the "SuperUser" user and
password (noted below), using these instructions:
http://mumble.sourceforge.net/Murmurguide#Becoming_Administrator_and_Registering_a_User

The only configuration required in "local.yaml" is the password of the
"SuperUser" mumble user (needed above). This must be at least 8 characters
long, and if this is not configured, the mumble server will not start.

Example local.yaml:
my-mumble:
   password: pass

Basic start-up example:

$ juju boostrap
$ juju deploy --config local.yaml --repository /scratch/ubuntu/vcs/juju-charms local:mumble-server my-mumble

Per-service unit channel tree creation:

$ juju deploy ... other-service
$ juju add-unit other-service
$ juju add-relation other-service my-mumble

The above relation will create the "other-service" channel with
sub-channels "0" and "1" (assuming that's how juju assigns the unit
numbers).
