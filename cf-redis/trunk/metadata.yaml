summary: Persistent key-value database with network interface
description: |
  Redis is a key-value database in a similar vein to memcache but the
  dataset is non-volatile. Redis additionally provides native support
  for atomically manipulating and querying data structures such as lists
  and sets.  The dataset is stored entirely in memory and periodically
  flushed to disk.
  This is the CloudFoundry specific Ensemble formula for redis-server
requires:
  cf-server:
    interface: cf-server
peers:
  redis-cluster:
    interface: redis
